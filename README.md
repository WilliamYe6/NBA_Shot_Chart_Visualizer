# Introduction 

This project was inspired by my passion for coding and basketball. So using Python, I decidded to create 
a shot chart visualizer where all shots attempted from a certain player during a specific season 
would get plotted onto a basketball graph. Special thanks to https://github.com/swar for great documentation 
of the NBA API.
